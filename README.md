# PotassiumES Components

*NOTE* We're still laying the foundation, so don't use this quite yet

This repository contains core UI elements used by [PotassiumES](https://github.com/PotassiumES/potassium-es).

Each UI element in PotassiumES (represented by a [Component](https://github.com/PotassiumES/potassium-es/blob/master/src/Component.js) class) works in three display modes: flat, portal, and immersive.

This repository contains a handy library of UI components that represent many of the UI elements that you're used to from HTML elements, like buttons, images, and text input fields.
